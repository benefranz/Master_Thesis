# The Pass-Through of a Temporary VAT Reduction in Germany: Evidence from Petrol Prices
Master's Thesis


## Overview
This repository consists out of the code used for my master's thesis at the University of Mannheim. I am aiming to replicate and extend the work by Montag, Sagimuldina, and Schnitzer (2020) on the pass-through of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany. This measure was implemented by the German government to mitigate the economic effects of Covid-19 during the second half of 2020 (01.07.2021 - 31.12.2021). France serves as the control group. Prices come from petrol stations as they need to be reported in both countries and, therefore, give a high frequency data basis.
